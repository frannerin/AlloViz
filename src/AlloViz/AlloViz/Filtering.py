class Filtering:
    r"""Class for network filtering

    Instances of this class are used to be added as attributes to instances of
    Wrappers' classes (as attributes of a :class:`AlloViz.Protein` object) with the
    purpose of storing (un)filtered networks according to different criteria.

    Raw network edges stored as a DataFrame in the passed `pkg` object are filtered with
    the corresponding function or combination of functions of the
    :mod:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering` module and converted to individual NetworkX'
    :external:ref:`Graphs <graph>` with :meth:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Analysis.Analysis._get_G`
    to be stored as private attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pkg : instance of a class from :mod:`AlloViz.Wrappers`
        The object is used to retrieve the raw network edges for network analysis. It
        also contains/gives access to the corresponding:class:`~AlloViz.Protein` object
        and its information.
    filtering : str or list
        Filtering scheme(s) with which to filter the list of network edges. A list of
        strings is used to filter with a combination of criteria. All available (and 
        combinable) filtering options are functions in the
        :mod:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering` module: 
        :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.All`,
        :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.GetContacts_edges`,

        :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.GPCR_Interhelix`,
        :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.Spatially_distant`.
    name : str
        Name of the filtering scheme. It will be the same name as the passed filtering
        option if it is a single string, or the names of the filtering options joined by
        "_" if a lsit has been passed. It is used to name the pkg's attribute in which
        the class instance is saved.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    GetContacts_threshold : float
        Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum contact
        frequency (0-1, default 0) threshold, which will be used to filter out
        contacts with a frequency (average) lower than it before analysis.
    Sequence_Neighbor_distance : int
        Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum number of sequence
        positions/distance between residues of a pair to retain in No_Sequence_Neighbors
        filtering, which defaults to 5.
    Interresidue_distance : int or float
        Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum number of angstroms
        that the CA atoms of residue pairs should have between each other in the initial
        PDB/structure (default 10 Å) to be considered spatially distant.

#     :class:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Analysis.Incontact` filtered data, as it only retains
#     edges between residue pairs that are at the same time `Incontact` and a certain
#     number of positions away in the protein sequence (default: 5), so to filter out
#     "uninteresting" raw edges in the network (see this class'
#     :meth:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Analysis.Intercontact._get_filt_data`).

#     Residues that are close in the protein sequence are always going to be detected by
#     `GetContacts` as if they were in physicochemical contact, because of their intrinsic
#     short spatial distance. Specially, it is known that a turn of an alpha-helix is
#     completed almost every 4 residues, and that thee residues i and i+4 in an alpha-helix
#     interact with a backbone hydrogen bond. Thus, to take out these interactions and also
#     the contacts due to closeness of residues i and i+5, the default value for
#     Intercontact filtering is 5 sequence positions.

#     Other Parameters
#     ----------------
#     **kwargs
#         `GetContacts_threshold` kwarg can be passed to specify the minimum contact
#         frequency (0-1, default 0) threshold, which will be used to filter out
#         contacts with a frequency (average) lower than it before analysis.
#         `Intercontact_distance` kwarg can be passed to specify the minimum number of
#         sequence positions/distance between residues of a pair to retain in Intercontact
#         filtering, which defaults to 5.
