"""Main AlloViz classes: `Protein` and `Delta`

The :class:`~AlloViz.Protein` class is AlloViz's main class, processing a structure and
trajectory(ies) input files and allowing to calculate, analyze and visualize the
allosteric communication networks with its associated methods.

The :class:`~AlloViz.Delta` class takes two :class:`~AlloViz.Protein` objects as input to
calculate the delta-network to highlight the differences in the allosteric communication
between two systems.
   
Notes
=====
This module is not meant to be used directly, as the classes are imported in the
namespace of AlloViz itself.

class Protein:

    Objects of the class process the input structure and trajectory files and allow to
    :meth:`~AlloViz.Protein.calculate` the different networks, which are stored in
    classes of the :mod:`AlloViz.Wrappers` module and can be filtered, analyzed and
    visualized with subsequent methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pdb : str
        Filename of the PDB structure to read, process and use.
    trajs : str or list
        Filename(s) of the MD trajectory (or trajectories) to read and use. File format
        must be recognized by MDAnalysis (e.g., xtc).
    GPCR : bool or int, default: False
        Use `True` if the structure is a GPCR, or pass the ID of a GPCRmd database
        dynamics entry, without specifying the `pdb` nor the `trajs` parameters, to
        automatically retrieve the files from the database and process them. They will
        be downloaded to `path`, which if left undefined will default to the GPCRmd ID.
    name : str, default: "protein"
        Name string to be used, e.g., for the title of the colorbar shown when
        representing a network with nglviewer.
    path : str, optional
        Path to store results in. It can exist already or not, and a new folder inside
        it called `data` will be created to store computation results and other
        files. If unspecified, it defaults to "." or the GPCRmd ID in case it is used.
    protein_sel : str, default: :attr:`AlloViz.Protein._protein_sel`
        MDAnalysis atom selection string to select the protein structure from the
        Universe (e.g., in case simulations in biological conditions are used, to avoid
        selecting extra chains, water molecules, ions...). It defaults to "(same segid as
        protein) and (not segid LIG) and (not chainid L)" and it can be extended using,
        e.g., :attr:`AlloViz.Protein._protein_sel` `+ " and {customselection}"`.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    psf : str, optional
        Optional kwarg of the filename of the .psf file corresponding to the pdb used.
        It is required alongside the `parameters` file to use the gRINN network
        construction method.
    parameters : str, optional
        Optional kwarg of the filename of the MD simulation force-field parameters file
        in NAMD format. It is required alongside the `psf` file to use the gRINN network
        construction method.
    special_res : dict, optional
        Optional kwarg of a dictionary containing a mapping of special residue 3/4-letter
        code(s) present in the structure to the corresponding standard 1-letter code(s).

    Attributes
    ----------
    pdb
    trajs
    GPCR
    protein : :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe`

    u : :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.universe.Universe`
        Universe of the processed pdb and trajectory files with only the `protein_sel`
        atoms.

    Raises

        Parameters
        ----------
        pkgs : str or list, default: "all"
            Package(s)/Network construction method(s) for which to send raw edge weight
            computation. "all" sends the computation for all available methods within
            AlloViz (check :data:`AlloViz.AlloViz.utils.pkgsl`).
        cores : int, default: 1
            Number of cores to use for parallelization with a `multiprocess` Pool.
            Default value only uses 1 core with a custom :class:`AlloViz.utils.dummypool`
            that performs computations synchronously.

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        taskcpus : int, optional
            Optional kwarg to specify the amount of cores that parallelizable network
            construction methods can use (i.e., AlloViz's method, getcontacts, dynetan,
            PyInteraph, MDEntropy and gRINN).
        stride : int, optional
            Optional kwarg to specify the striding to be done on the trajectory(ies) for
            computationally-expensive network construction methods: i.e., dynetan and
            AlloViz's own method. Default is no striding.
        namd : str, optional
            Optional kwarg pointing to the namd2 executable location; if the `namd`
            command is accessible through the CLI it is automatically retrieved with the
            `distutils` package.
        GetContacts_threshold : float, optional
            Optional kwarg to specify the minimum contact frequency (0-1, default 0)
            threshold for GetContacts results, which will be used to filter out contacts
            with a frequency (average) lower than it.
        chis : int, optional
            Optional kwarg to specify the number of side-chain chi dihedral angles (up to
            5, default) to combine when sending the calculation of a child of the 
            Combined_Dihs Wrappers' base class that includes chi dihedrals in its
            calculation.
        MDEntropy_method : str, optional, {"knn", "grassberger", "chaowangjost"}
            Optional kwarg to specify the method to calculate the entropy of the
            variables for Mutual Information estimation when using one of the
            MDEntropy network construction methods (default: "knn").

        See Also
        --------

        AlloViz.Protein.filter : Class method to filter the network raw edge
                                 weights with different criteria.
        AlloViz.Protein.analyze : Class method to analyze the calculated raw edge weights

        Notes
        -----
        Calculation results are stored as new instance attributes with the same name as
        the selected packages/network construction methods. If the object is created
        providing more than one trajectory file, the average and standard error of the
        weights between the replicas are also calculated.

        Filter the networks according to the selected criteria to perform analyses on
        (all or) a subset of the edges. It calls
        :meth:`AlloViz.Wrappers.Base.Base.filter` and results are stored in instances
        of the :class:`AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.Filtering` class. The different filtering
        options are detailed in the :mod:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering` module.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pkgs : str or list, default: "all"
            Package(s)/Network construction method(s) for which to analyze their raw edge
            weights, which must be already calculated and their data saved as instance
            attribute. In this case, "all" sends the computation for all available
            methodsthat are already calculated and saved as instance attributes.
        filterings : str or list of strs and/or lists, default: "all"
            Filtering scheme(s) with which to filter the list of network edges before
            analysis. It can be a string, or a list of strings and/or lists. A list of
            lists (also with or without strings) is used to filter with a combination of
            criteria. All available (and combinable) filtering options are functions in
            the :mod:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering` module: 
            :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.All`,
            :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.GetContacts_edges`,
            :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.No_Sequence_Neighbors`,
            :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.GPCR_Interhelix`. The default "all"
            performs all the available filtering schemes (no combinations).
        
        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        GetContacts_threshold : float
            Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum contact frequency
            (0-1, default 0) threshold, which will be used to filter out contacts with a
            frequency (average) lower than it before analysis.
        Sequence_Neighbor_distance : int
            Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum number of sequence
            positions/distance between residues of a pair to retain in
            `No_Sequence_Neighbors` filtering, which defaults to 5.
        Interresidue_distance : int or float
            Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum number of angstroms
            that the CA atoms of residue pairs should have between each other in the initial
            PDB/structure (default 10 Å) to be considered spatially distant.

#         Notes
#         -----
#         Method returns nothing, but analysis results are stored as nested attributes
#         "inside" each of the packages' attributes of the :class:`~AlloViz.Protein` object,
#         first using the name of the filtering scheme (e.g., `.Package.filterby`) and
#         lastly with the analyzed network element name (e.g., `.Package.filterby.element`).
#         If the `Protein` object was created providing more than one trajectory file, the
#         analyses are performed both on the replicas' weights and the average, and an
#         average and standard error of the replicas' analysis results are also calculated.

#         "Incontact" filtering only retains edges of residue pairs in contact -those for
#         which GetContacts is able to compute contact frequencies-, and "Intercontact"
#         only keeps edges of pairs that are both in contact and apart in the sequence (more
#         than 5 positions away in the sequence).

class Delta:
    r"""AlloViz class for calculating a delta-network.

    Used to calculate the delta-network between two :class:`~AlloViz.Protein` objects,
    using all the available combinations of packages/network construction methods,
    filterings, and elements-metrics that they have in common. A structural alignment of
    the structures is performed with PyMOL with the selected method to find the
    corresponding residues between the two structures for subtraction of edge weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    refstate : :class:`AlloViz.Protein`
        Object of the :class:`AlloViz.Protein` class to use as reference (values of the
        other :class:`AlloViz.Protein` object will be subtracted from this one's values).
    state2 : :class:`AlloViz.Protein`
        Object of the :class:`AlloViz.Protein` class to compare with the reference one to
        build the delta-network (this one's values will be subtracted from the reference
        one's values).
    pymol_aln : {"super", "align", "cealign"}, default: "super"
        PyMOL's method to apply for the structural alignment of the two structures, used
        to retrieve the corresponding residues between the two for subtraction of edge
        weights. It is performed by :meth:`AlloViz.Delta._make_struct_aln`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    refstate
    state2

    See Also
    --------
    AlloViz.Protein : AlloViz main class for calculation of protein allosteric
                      communication networks.

    Notes
    -----
    For PyMOL's structural alignment, `align` starts from a sequence alignment and is
    optimal to align structures with identical sequences, but is deeply affected by
    sequence differences. `super` performs a sequence-independent dynamic programming
    structural alignment and it works well for structures with low sequence identity.
    `cealign` uses the Combinatorial Extension (CE) algorithm and it is preferred for
    structures with little to no sequence similarity (twilight zone). The methods are
    described in `PyMOL's documentation <https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page>`_.

    --------
    >>> activeB2AR = AlloViz.Protein(GPCR=117, name="Active B2AR")
