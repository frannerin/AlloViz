"""Base module for package/software wrapping for AlloViz

Main :class:`~AlloViz.Wrappers.Base.Base` class stores the information about the
:class:`~AlloViz.Protein` object and defines the general private methods that most
child classes use to launch, manage and store the network calculations. It exploits the
'__new__' special method to establish the object's attributes and that can be extended in
the child classes and '__init__' is used to launch calculations, which can be extended or
overriden by child classes.

In this module there are additional classes that override or extend 
:class:`~AlloViz.Wrappers.Base.Base`'s private methods and that are used to be combined
to create child classes with multiple inheritance for specific uses.

        of the :class:`AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.Filtering` class. The different filtering
        options are detailed in the :mod:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering` module.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filterings : str or list of strs and/or lists, default: "all"
            Filtering scheme(s) with which to filter the list of network edges before
            analysis. It can be a string, or a list of strings and/or lists: a list of
            lists (also with or without strings) is used to filter with a combination of
            criteria. All available (and combinable) filtering options are functions in

            :func:`~AlloViz.AlloViz.Filtering.All`,

            performs all the available filtering schemes (no combinations).
        
        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        GetContacts_threshold : float
            Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum contact frequency
            (0-1, default 0) threshold, which will be used to filter out contacts with a
            frequency (average) lower than it before analysis.
        Sequence_Neighbor_distance : int
            Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum number of sequence
            positions/distance between residues of a pair to retain in
            `No_Sequence_Neighbors` filtering, which defaults to 5.
        Interresidue_distance : int or float
            Optional kwarg that can be passed to specify the minimum number of angstroms
            that the CA atoms of residue pairs should have between each other in the initial
             PDB/structure (default 10 Å) to be considered spatially distant.
