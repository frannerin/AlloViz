"""CARDS network construction method wrapper

It calculates the Mutual Information (MI) generalized correlation of the residues'
dihedral angles, and also the MI of their disorder, the MI between their values and their
disorder (pure disorder or disorder-mediated) and the holistic MI (MI of the values plus
of the disorder), and also their combinations.
