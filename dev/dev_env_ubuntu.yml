  # Pkgs and deps
  #- vmd-python>=3.0 # for getcontacts # NOT AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS
  #git+https://github.com/Eigenstate/vmd-python@master # needed for pip because it's not on PyPi, although it didn't work
  - expat # needed for vmd-python and available in all platforms
  - tk # >=8.5,<8.6 # needed to compile vmd-python in windows and available in all platforms; from intel channel

  # - natsort # for gRINN
  # - click # probably for gRINN too

  #parmed # for dcd generation; ambertools is going to be a dependency so :D
  #mdtraj and parmed are needed for dcd generation and thus for gRINN; they might be installed for other reasons (mdtraj is needed for MD-TASK and parmed comes with ambertools)

  # These two may be needed to successfully install msmbuilder
  #gxx_linux-64 # necessary for msmbuilder
  - compilers # trying to substitute gxx
  #fastcluster is also missing

  # pyyaml is needed for psntools
